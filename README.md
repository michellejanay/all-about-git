### What is version control?
**Version Control** is used for any situation where you are creating content. It assists in keeping track of all the changes to a document, allowing you to go back to earlier versions. It can provide an off-site copy of data and it supports collaboration. 

### What is Git?
**Git** is a version control system. It is fast, modern and fully-featured, while also being open source and free. Git also allows for distribution, where you can have local and remote copies of files.

### Installing Git
